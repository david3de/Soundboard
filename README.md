# Soundboard
Personal soundboard to test capabilities of PHP. To add sounds to the soundboard, just place audio files (preferably MP3, other types may not be supported across all browsers) into the `/files` directory.

File names are restricted:
>File names must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods.

# Soundboard
Personal soundboard to test capabilities of PHP. To add sounds to the soundboard, just place audio files (preferably MP3, other types may not be supported across all browsers) into the `/files` directory. Make sure PHP in enabled on your server.

File names are restricted:
>File names must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods.

## To Do
-Have better CSS

-Preload audio files so that the user doesn't have to load the file every time a button is clicked
